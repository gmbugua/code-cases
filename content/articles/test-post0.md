### Have you ever wanted to build a ***custom, lightweight and easy*** to manage blog? 

*Unfortunately, there are hundreds of ways to build one and not all of them are well integrated with one another.*

In my research I found that a markdown based blog, built primarily with Nuxt.js and Nuxt Content was the most straightforward way to start content creating without too much of a learning curve.

As a result, without any knowledge of Vue, Nuxt or Nuxt Content I leaped in and developed my Code Cases blog from scratch.

## Installation

```shell
# initialize nuxt app
yarn create nuxt-app <project-name>

# navigate to project directory
cd <project-name>

# isntall nuxt content
yarn add @nuxt/content

# start your dev server
yarn dev
```

## Configuration
